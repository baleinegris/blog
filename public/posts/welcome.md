Hi and welcome to my blog! I'm Oscar Heath, aka Baleinegris, which you probably know if you're even reading my blog. I decided to start my blog because I wanted a fun non-backend project to work on this summer, and my portfolio got so bloated I wanted to make a simpler website. If the favicon didn't tip you off, I'm hosting this website off of my new Raspberry Pi 4 (Rocinante), which I just configured as a web server, and this is sort of a test website for it. I'm now totally self-hosted, and as you can see I'm now on the domain "baleinegris.site," which I'm very happy about. But yeah, I partly also set up this blog to deploy a brand new website to my domain and Pi.

### Things to expect on the blog

- **Project write-ups**: This is sort of the main reason I made this blog, since I wanted somewhere to put longer write ups of my projects, something more like DevPost write-ups. Once I started working on more complicated projects I became harder to yap to people about them, and I wanted somewhere to talk about them, so I figure the internet is as good a place as any.
Plus this means I can link my projects on my CV and stuff to something more substantial than just a README. 

- **Posts about life**: Since this is a blog I'll also write some posts about life or opinions. This is my first time blogging so I still feel kinda self conscious about being a cheeseball but we'll see how it goes. I'll probably write up something like once per semester/summer? Like how life is going and what I'm interested in. The blogging idea is sort of inspired by my friend [Punpun's blog](https://punnpunnpunn.github.io/blog), so shout out to him.

- **Home lab stuff**: I've been having so much fun messing around with my home lab stuff that I'll probably post updates about what stuff I'm running on my Raspberry Pi and NAS. 

- **Tier Lists**: I plan on making fun random tier lists for things like UofT classes, games, books, etc...
